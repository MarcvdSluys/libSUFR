  !!  libSUFR is a LIBrary of Some Useful Fortran Routines that I wrote for my own use, but that may also be
  !!  useful for others.  It currently also "SUFRs" from the fact that Fortran module files are compiler
  !!  dependent.  libSUFR is available for free under the conditions of the EUPL v.1.2.
